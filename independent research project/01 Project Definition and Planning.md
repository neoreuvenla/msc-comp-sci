## **1.3 Aims of the Independent Research Project**

### **1.3.0 Reading**
* *Required: [The ‘Campus Imaginary’: Online Students’ Experience Of The Masters Dissertation At A Distance](https://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy.york.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1080/13562517.2017.1319809), Ross and Sheail*
* *Extension: none*

&emsp;
### **1.3.1 The Independent Research Project**

The **Independent Research Project** (IRP) is the implementation and write up of the plan submitted in the previous **Research Proposal** (RP) module. It could include:
* Software or hardware engineering
* Scientific method of hypothesis generation and experiment
* Or other suitable and accepted proposals

The **skills** required to complete this longer piece of sustained research and writing have been developed across the course:
* Critical analytical skills
* Ability to gather and synthesise literature and data from a range of sources
* Academic writing skills
* Subject specific knowledge
* Self management
* Working to deadlines

The nature of **distance independent self study** can feel isolating. Being aware of this prior to starting can help prepare for the upcoming experiences.

&emsp;
#### **Essential Information:**

The information for this module is presented in four **phases** over 16 weeks, rather than the weekly structure of previous modules:

</p>

While the material for all phases should be read within the first five weeks, it is expected that the information will be **revisited** and **reviewed** as needed during the project itself.

## **1.4 Phase 1 - Literature, Ethics, and Supervision**

### **1.4.0 Reading**
* *Required: none*
* *Extension: none*

&emsp;
### **1.4.1 Research Proposal**

Every **research project** requires a **research proposal** explaining the relevant literature, methodology, and methods.

It is expected to use the submission from the previous **Research Proposal** (RP) module, although these initial proposals usually require **refinement** before proceeding.
* This will be reviewed with the assigned supervisor
* Changes may relate to the **question**, **scope**, or **approach**
* The process is iterative and multiple changes are expected
* The result from this process is part of the **output** from Phase 1

It is possible to submit a new research proposal, although this will result in a condensed research proposal being submitted to the supervisor as soon as possible.

As explained in the RP module, the **research proposal** should include:
* An **introduction** explaining the field of study, unit of analysis and objectives
* A **literature review** providing relevant context
* A specific **research question** or problem
* Identification adn explanation of the intended **methodology**
* An outline of **data sources**
* A statement of the **ethical implications** and fast track approval form if needed
* The intended **timeframe**, ideally displayed as a Gantt Chart or a timetable
* A full **reference list**

&emsp;
### **1.4.2 Literature Review**

The **literature review** should be an account of what other people have done in this field before. It includes:
* A literature review 
* Accounts of other people's research
* Historical information necessary to place the investigation in context

Good literature reviews organise the material into **themes** and draw out the main points on which previous writers agree or disagree.

It is more than a series of **mini book reviews** or a **chronological account** of what was done and when. Rather, it should lay the **foundation** for the study by identifying significant issues arising from previous work.

The **conclusion** of the review should summarise the findings and explain how they informed the development of the study's research question.

&emsp;
#### **Refining the Review:**
************************************
As a recap: 
* **Research Methods** (RM) - covered reviewing the literature in relation to identifying the research topic and included a brief overview of the types of literature available, how and where to find good sources of literature and critically review these in relation to the chosen field of study. 

The Research Proposal module provided in-depth information on the role of the literature review in the research process with guidance on how to access, read and review different types of literature and how to write up a literature review. You will have put these skills to good use when writing your research proposal. 

&emsp;
### **1.4.3 Ethics Approval**

**Research ethics** were considered in both the previous **Research Methods** (RM) and **Research Proposal** (RP) modules.

All research undertaken by university students and staff require **ethical approval**, which is particularly important for **primary research** involving real people.

It is mandatory for all students on the **Independent Research Project** (IRP) module to have completed a fast track **Research Ethics form** and, if necessary, a **full ethics form**.
* The supervisor will discuss whether a full ethics form is needed
* Data should not be collected prior to recieving **ethics approval**

The end of week 3 is the **deadline** for submission of full ethics forms.

&emsp;
#### **Completing the Ethics Form:**

A **pilot survey** or **interview** may be needed to demonstrate testing for unexpected ethical issues.

All **data** collected through research needs to be **securely stored**:
* Hard copies should be locked away
* Electronic data should be on an encrypted, password protected computer
* Back ups should be made regularly on encrypted hard drives

The main ethical issues relating to this project are **informed consent**, **confidentiality** and **anonymisation of data**.
* Informed consent for participants requires an information sheet and consent form
* This will detail basic information about the research and their role within it
* Participants should be informed they have the right to withdraw at any time
* Participants also need to be guaranteed anonymity and confidentiality 
* A copy of the form should be included in the **appendix** of the proposal, if needed

The design of any **survey questionnaires** or **interview guides** must be submitted to the supervisor for approval before use. These should also be added to the **appendix**, if used.

A model **information sheet** and **consent form** can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iELyOFFvjY75zvzlRCSDTEUiERb43BJTehyAo9mUCfE/edit?usp=sharing).

&emsp;
### **1.4.4 IRP Supervisor**

Supervisors are allocated according to the topic area detailed on the **Research Proposal** (RP) summative. This attempts to match supervisors with specific expertise to the area of study.

Supervision is primarily about guiding students through the process of a conducting research project and presenting the findings from a position of experience.

The **first meeting** should be arranged to occur before the end of Week 2. A copy of the previously submitted proposal should also be made available.

&emsp;
#### **Contact:**

The minimum level of contact with the supervisor can be expected to be:
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/01/0102supervisormeetings.jpg" alt="Supervisor meetings">
</p>

Additionally, the supervisor can be contacted by **email** with an expected response within 3 working days.

It is the responsibility of the **student** to contact their **supervisor** and arrange meeting times and dates suitable for both parties. It is recommended to set dates for the next meeting at the end of each meeting.

&emsp;
#### **Expectations:**

The supervisor is **expected** to:
* Advise on appropriate forms of **research methods**
* Regularly review **work** and **progress**
* Offer **constructive criticism** of ideas and writing
* Advise on the **standard** necessary to pass the project
* Help navigate university **rules** and **regulations**

However, the supervisor is **not expected** to:
* **Proof read** or correct use of English
* **Direct** what to research or to write

The expectation of the student centres around the **planning**, **conduct**, and **organisation**. Therefore, a successful student should be:
* Actively **engage** in the IRP process
* **Self-disciplined** and **hard working**
* Prepared for **meetings** and **discussions**
* Willing to listen and take **advice**
* Seek **help** when needed

**Significant problems** or **set backs** should be shared with the supervisor at the earliest opportunity.
