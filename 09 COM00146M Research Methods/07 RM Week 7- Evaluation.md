## **7.3 Validity And Ethics**

### **7.3.0 Reading**
* *Required: [Introduction To Data Ethics – A Lecture By Dr. Brent Mittelstadt](https://onlinestudy.york.ac.uk/courses/1026/files/360703?wrap=1)*
* *Required: [Turing’s Data Ethics Group Supports The Development Of The NHS Code Of Conduct For Data Driven Health And Care Technology](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/public-policy/programme-articles/turings-data-ethics-group-supports-development-nhs-code-conduct-data-driven-health-and-care)*
* *Extension: none* 

&emsp;
### **7.3.1 Validity**

Literature stresses that research design must ensure data and results are relevant, reliable, valid, and credible.

The method of **data collection** must be carefully designed both in terms of content and structure.
* Language should be self explanatory, unambiguous and clear
* Questions asked should be specific and clearly articulated 
* Together, these help avoid bias and increases validity

The researcher must also be proficient in use of the **data collection instrument**.
* Lack of technical skill could affect results
* Inconsistent verbal and non verbal actions could introduce bias

**Data validity** is achieved through sampling.
* Sampling is a balance between practicalites of access and research purpose
* If a study requires generalisation of findings, the sampling approach must support this

&emsp;
### **7.3.2 Ethics**

**Research ethics** involve conducting research in a responsibile and morally defensible way.

While it seems straightforward to do the right thing, it can be particularly complex when research involves interactions with human subjects.

&emsp;
#### **Ethics In Practice:**

Dr Mittelstadt used the term **data ethics** to describe the moral principles that govern how we should collect, use, and share data:
* The proliferation of digital technologies has increased concern around data ethics
* Ethical considerations include **privacy**, **fairness**, **transparency**, **accountability**, and **impact**
* There is potential for bias in data collection and analysis that needs to be controlled
* Ethical frameworks such as consequentialism and deontology can mitigate concerns
* Some professions provide ethical codes and guidelines which should, or must, be adhered to

The Alan Turing Institute's Data Ethics Group commented on the ethical use of data within the NHS.
* Technology can improve service and alleviate budgetary pressures
* However, a code of conduct is needed for data-driven health care technology
* This code must comply with regulatory obligations and bioethical principles
* The wider social implications of data and AI drive health services must be explicitly considered
* The code must be practically implemented and compliance demonstrated in order to have the desired impact

&emsp;
#### **Ethical Considerations In Research:**

Ethical issues can potentially arise at each stage of the research process.

There are three areas that underpin ethical research practice:
* **Obligations** - non-negotiable legal, professional, cultural, and personal norms that must be adhered to
* **Responsibilities** - the safety of particpants, stakeholders, and society must be ensured, including the effect of any power dynamics  
* **Expected standards** - includes avoiding hard, obtaining informed consent, respecting privacy, and avoiding deception

Avoiding harm includes being aware of potential **physical**, **mental**, or **emotional** harm.

Good informed consent provides participants with sufficient information about the research and allowing consent to be withdrawn at any time.

Agreed views regarding respecting privacy may be superseded by local laws, such as **GDPR**.

Ethical practice is important for maintaining reputation of researchers and institutions.
