## **7.2 Summary**

Peers can be an excellent source of feedback and constructive criticism. However, due to the nature of distance learning and the university policies, care should be taken that any collaborative review does not cross into collusion.

## **7.3 Evaluating A Proposal**

### **7.3.0 Reading**
* *Required: none*

### **7.3.1 Peer Critique**

While care needs to be taken to prevent **collusion**, constructive criticism from peers can be a useful source of improvements. 

**Gaps** in the research proposal could be uncovered by thinking about:
* What are the overarching **objectives** of the project?
* Are their **hypotheses** and **questions** clearly identified?
* Have the **ethical implications** been identified and addressed?
* What are their **methodology** and **methods**?
* Have they presented a plan that is **realistic**?

It can be useful to consider whether there are any common themes or issues that arise from critique of multiple peers. This potentially can highlight shared areas for improvement.

Feedback does not have to be accepted, but should at least be reflected on.
