</p>

Research methods can be classified according to their timeframe. Which to choose depends on the nature of the research and the intended outcome.
* **Cross-sectional** studies provide a snapshot of a situation or event as a particular point in time
* **Longitudinal** studies provide a long term picture, where data is gathered over a period of time

&emsp;
### **3.3.2 Research Design, Questions, and Hypotheses**

Research design, questions, and hypotheses are all crucial components of academic research process. 

&emsp;
#### **Purpose of Research Design:**

Simply, **research design** is a blueprint for research: a strategy that guides the researcher in planning and implementing a study in a way most likely to achieve the intended goal.

It outlines:
* What data to gather
* How to collect it
* How to analyse it

In **mixed methods** research, the design will ensure that both **qualitative** and **quantitative** aspects complement each other in understanding the investigated phenomenon.

&emsp;
#### **Research Questions and Hypotheses:**

A **research question** is a clearly defined question that the study seeks to answer. It could be:
* Open ended
* Exploratory
* Qualitative or quantitative in nature

However, **hypotheses** are specific predictions about the possible outcomes of the research. 
* In quantitative studies, hypotheses are often statements about the expected relationships between variables
* Mixed methods research may have both quantitative and qualitative hypotheses

&emsp;
#### **Role in the Research Process:**

Research is iterative and rarely neat, however the process can broadly be represented as:

</p>

A **research project** should start with a clearly defined research questions or hypothesis.
* The **question** should be specific and narrow the focus of the study
* Generally, qualitative research questions start with words like *how* and *what*
* Mixed methods research questions should directly address the integration both elements
* **Hypotheses** should be testable predictions about the expected outcomes
* These are generally articulated as either alternative or null hypotheses

Both questions and hypotheses should be directly linked to the context of the study. 

**Research symmetry** implies that irrespective of what the findings are, they should have a similar value. This means that every hypothesis should be framed in a way that it yields meaningful and valuable insight.

## **3.4 Making Choices**

### **3.4.0 Reading**
* *Required: Chapter 7, Projects In Computing And Information Systems: A Student's Guide, Dawson*
* *Required: Chapters 1-6, Dissertations and Project Reports: A Step by Step Guide, Cottrell*
* *Required: [Toward Principles of Construct Clarity: Exploring the
Usefulness of Facet Theory in Guiding Conceptualization](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294108825_Toward_Principles_of_Construct_Clarity_Exploring_the_Usefulness_of_Facet_Theory_in_Guiding_Conceptualization), Zhang et al*
* *Extension: Chapters 7, 8, Projects In Computing And Information Systems: A Student's Guide, Dawson*

&emsp;
### **3.4.1 Balancing Requirements**

Undertaking a research project involves balancing competing requirements:
* What is **possible** - conceptually and theoretically possible
* What is **practical** - real world limitations on time and resources
* What is **required** - degree requirements, career development etc...

Time is an important resource and effective **time management** is important throughout long term research projects:
* **Personal time** - identify issues that may arise, such as a lack of routine or everyday commitments
* **Allocating time** - consider the broad project processes involved and use planning tools for scheduling
* **Pacing work** - working little and often, contingency planning, and realistic mini-goal setting can help
* **Maintaining momentum** - motivation can be maintained through strict routines and acknowledging achievements

Procrastination in writing up projects is common. Therefore, it is important to plan for writing early on. **Good enough** standards and section deadlines should be decided on. 

It is important to understand the role of a **supervisor** in the project: they provide guidance, direction, and feedback, but not day to day supervision. Establishing good everyday habits is down to the researcher.
